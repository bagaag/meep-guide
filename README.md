MeepCraft, The Missing Manual
==========

Here is everything you need to know to get started with MeepCraft, the world's greatest Minecraft server. The official website for Meepcraft is at http://meepcraft.com. Definitely spend some time checking out that site. As great as it is, I never found a single place with all this information. So here it is.

One of the first things you'll probably want to do is play some mini games. Meepcraft has lots of great games. Playing (and winning) games is one of the best ways to earn Meeples (money) in Meepcraft. Go to /spawn and browse, or use the following shortcuts to get to your favorite game:

/hg - Hunger Games - Compete to survive with other players to the death with timed chest drops. Right click the feather you spawn with in the game to choose from one of the kits. You make good $ in this
