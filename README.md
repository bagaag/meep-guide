MeepCraft, The Missing Manual
==========

Here is everything you need to know to get started with MeepCraft, the world's greatest Minecraft server. The official website for Meepcraft is at http://meepcraft.com. Definitely spend some time checking out that site, [especially the rules](http://meepcraft.com/forums/rules.27/). What it lacks, however, is a comprehensive getting started guide. So here it is.

1. About Commands
-----------

Commands are keywords that tell Meepcraft to do something. Perhaps the first command you should learn is `/spawn`. Enter it by typing it, complete with the initial / character, on your keyboard while in MeepCraft. `/spawn` will take you back to the server's home, called Spawn.

2.  Minigames<a name="minigames"></a>
-------------

One of the first things you'll probably want to do is play some minigames. These are games within MeepCraft that you can play against (or with) other players. Playing (and winning) games is one of the best ways to earn Meebles (money) in Meepcraft. Go to /spawn and browse, or use the following shortcuts to get to your favorite game:

/hg - Hunger Games - Compete to survive with other players to the death with timed chest drops. Right click the feather you spawn with in the game to choose from one of the kits.

/skyblock - Skyblock - Claim a miniature island floating in the sky and use the few resources you have to earn acheivements and gain additional resources. The MeepCraft community adds a whole new dimension to the game.

/boomo - Boomo - A MeepCraft original game. Navigate a maze of shrubs and explode your way through it (and other players) with TNT. Last one standing wins.
